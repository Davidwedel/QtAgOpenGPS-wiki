Welcome to the QtAgOpenGPS wiki!
This wiki is concerned mainly with developing, and compiling source code. 

Here's a short summary of the different wiki pages:

[Android-Test-Build](https://github.com/torriem/qtagopengps/wiki/android-test-build)<br>
Contains basic instructions on compiling a Qt example on Android

[Build For Android Linux](https://github.com/torriem/qtagopengps/wiki/Build-for-android-linux)<br>
Building QtAOG for Android on Linux. (Use this after you have built QtAOG on your desktop)

[Contributing to Source](https://github.com/torriem/qtagopengps/wiki/contributing-to-source)<br>
Contains some helpful notes on porting from C#, as well as a few things we've learned about QML along the way.

[Contributing to Wiki](https://github.com/torriem/qtagopengps/wiki/contributing-to-wiki)<br>
Explains how the wiki works, and how to contribute.

[Installing and Compiling Linux](https://github.com/torriem/qtagopengps/wiki/installing-and-compiling-linux)<br>
How to install and set up Qt, download QtAOG source, and compile the code on Linux

[Installing and Compiling Windows](https://github.com/torriem/qtagopengps/wiki/installing+compiling-windows)<br>
How to install and set up Qt, download QtAOG source, and compile the code on Windows

[Qt For Android on Windows](https://github.com/torriem/qtagopengps/wiki/Qt-for-android-on-windows)<br>
Building QtAOG for Android on Android. (Use this after you have built QtAOG on your desktop)<br>

[Setting Up Local QML](https://github.com/torriem/qtagopengps/wiki/setting-up-local-qml)<br>
This is a must-have for QML development. It loads the QML files on QtAOG startup instead of compiling them in to the binary. Turns waiting for the compiler to slowly compile them into a basic reloading of QtAOG.
